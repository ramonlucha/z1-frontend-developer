### Using test for testing some text and some elements on our view.

We added some test that allows to know if we had some error on our code

### changes

we had to simulate the camera because we do not have a cam on our pc so we couldn't test the code properly.

### Future Changes

-add more and more efficient tests
-try to add the library that allows us to use the camera when we have a camera
